## Qodly Studio

<h3>What's new</h3>

:::info Highlights

- **New [Page States](../../4DQodlyPro/pageLoaders/states/stateOverview.md) Feature**: Introducing Page states for dynamically applying various changes to Qodly pages. This feature is useful for modifying the user interface (UI), styling, and other properties on the fly, allowing developers to tailor pages to specific privileges, Qodly Source values, contexts, or scenarios without relying heavily on server-side processing.
- **Explorer Enhancements**: Improved ergonomics for classes in the Explorer.

:::

- New [`onInit`](../../4DQodlyPro/pageLoaders/pageLoaderOverview.md#triggers-and-events) Event for the Page: This event is executed during the rendering phase and is used to perform any necessary setup actions when a component is first created.

- Disable Components: Some components can now be disabled. When disabled, their associated actions are not triggered, and they appear with special rendering. This is particularly useful when using the [Page states](../../4DQodlyPro/pageLoaders/states/stateOverview.md) feature.

- Image Component Enhancement: You can now [drag and drop an image from the shared folder](../../4DQodlyPro/pageLoaders/components/image.md#drag-and-drop-from-shared-folder) into the image source and set the default image source.

- New [Clean Standard Action](../../4DQodlyPro/pageLoaders/events/bindingActionToEvents.md#qodly-sources): The Clean standard action allows entity selections to be cleaned of their deleted entities, preventing blank spaces in the UI.

- Contextual Panel Update: The Contextual panel now allows function call actions to be [copied](../../4DQodlyPro/pageLoaders/events/eventsManagement.md#copying-an-event-action) or [pasted](../../4DQodlyPro/pageLoaders/events/eventsManagement.md#pasting-an-event-action) and called [function names to be changed post-creation](../../4DQodlyPro/pageLoaders/events/eventsManagement.md#modifying-a-function-call), avoiding the need to delete and recreate them.

- [Singletons in Qodly Studio](../qodlyScript/basics/lang-classes.md#singleton-classes): Singletons can now be edited in Qodly Studio. Their functions can be called from a Qodly page, and permissions can be set up for their functions.

- Terminology Update: To improve accuracy, some Qodly concepts have been renamed: webforms are now **Pages**, and datasources are now **Qodly sources**.

- Japanese Character Support: Japanese characters are now supported in all elements created in Qodly.

- Scalar Qodly Source Type: Scalar Qodly source types can now be changed post-creation, eliminating the need to delete and recreate them.

- Sanity Check for Image Component: Added a warning for Qodly Source.

- Dialogs Grouping: Dialogs are now grouped in the outline and can be opened from it.

- Pages Editor Update: Enhanced the cancel component creation feature.

- Date Display Fix: Dates will now display empty content instead of "Invalid date" if the date is !00.00.00!.

- Cancel Component Creation: Users can now cancel the creation of a component by dragging it out of the canvas or by pressing Escape.
