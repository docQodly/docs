## Qodly Studio

<h3>What's new</h3>


- New [`onPrivilegeChange`](../../4DQodlyPro/pageLoaders/pageLoaderOverview.md#triggers-and-events) Event: Ensures elements display based on user privileges.

- [Sanity check](../../4DQodlyPro/pageLoaders/pageLoaderOverview.md#sanity-check) Update: Raises an error if a shared selection attribute is dropped over a matrix bound to a local selection.

- [Binding onHttpGet Functions](../../4DQodlyPro/pageLoaders/events/bindingActionToEvents.md#binding-onhttpget-functions): Enables binding functions for HTTP GET requests with [4D.OutgoingMessage](../qodlyScript/OutgoingMessageClass.md), supporting flexible operations like file viewing or downloads.

- [Toggle Inherited Permissions](../../4DQodlyPro/roles/permissionsOverview.md#showhide-inherited-permissions): Allows visibility toggling to show only explicitly defined permissions or include inherited ones by default in the privileges interface.

- [Default State Override Warning](../../4DQodlyPro/pageLoaders/states/stateOverview.md#setting-a-default-state): Displays a warning icon when the Default State will be overridden by an unmet Conditional State condition, with a tooltip explaining the override.
