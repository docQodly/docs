On the [Billing page](../console/billingSubscriptionManagement.md), you can view all your invoices, the amount of your next invoice, and your credit card information. Qodly uses Stripe to handle payments. If you have a Stripe account, you can use it, or you can add your own card. You can change your card at any time.

If there's an issue with the credit card during renewal, you will automatically receive email alerts from [Stripe](https://stripe.com). You will have very limited access for one month, after which your application will be automatically deleted. Please address the problem promptly as soon as you receive the Stripe notification.
