Events serve as a mechanism for initiating specific actions, often employed to trigger particular behaviors. They collaborate with various actions to establish dynamic interactions within an application.

For instance, when a user interacts with a webpage by clicking a button, you have the flexibility to determine the response, whether it involves invoking a function or opening another webpage. Furthermore, events can be activated in response to [updates in a Qodly Source](#qodly-source-events).

Within Qodly Studio, events play a pivotal role in executing code on the Qodly web server, without requiring any supplementary JavaScript.



## Types of Events

Events can be set to trigger either when end-users perform specific actions or when qodlysources are updated.

### User events

You can configure events to activate in response to specific actions performed by end-users, such as clicking buttons, moving the mouse cursor, and more.

Typical user events include `On Click`, `On DblClick`, `On MouseEnter`, `On Keyup`, and others. The available events may vary depending on the selected component, and detailed documentation can be found in the **Triggers and Events section** on each component's page.

### Qodly Source events

Besides events triggered by end-user actions, events can also be automated to respond when qodlysources undergo changes. Qodly Sources support two distinct events: the `On Change` event and the `On Init` event.


#### On Init

The `On Init` event is triggered when the Qodly Source is instantiated by the renderer. It provides an opportunity to set up an initial value for the Qodly Source. Actions or function calls bound to the `On Init` event should focus solely on initializing that specific Qodly Source.

#### On Change

When the `On Change` event is linked to a Qodly Source, it will trigger in the following scenarios:

|Trigger|Description|
|---|---|
|Qodly Source|<li>The reference pointed to by the qodlysource changes in the web browser (not on the server)</li><li>The entity is [touched](../../../language/EntityClass.md#touched)</li>|
|Entity Qodly Source|The contents of the entity attribute change|
|Entity Selection Qodly Source| <li>The reference pointed by the qodlysource changes in the web browser (not on the server)</li><li>An entity is added to the entity selection</li>|
|Scalar Qodly Source|The contents of the scalar qodlysource change|

## Circular Dependency Risk

Using the `Reload` standard action within an `On Change` event can create a circular dependency. This causes Qodly Studio to enter an infinite loop of reloading, which results in the application freezing.

When you set an **On Change** event to reload the qodly source, the following happens:

- A change in the qodly source triggers the On Change event.

- The On Change event contains a Reload standard action.

- The Reload standard action causes the qodly source to reload, which is considered a change.

- This change triggers the On Change event again.

This creates a loop:

    Change → On Change Event → Reload Standard Action → Change → On Change Event → Reload Standard Action → ...

This loop continues indefinitely until Qodly Studio runs out of resources or crashes, leading to the application freezing.
