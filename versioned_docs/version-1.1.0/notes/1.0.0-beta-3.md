## Qodly Studio

<h3> What's New </h3>

- Introduced the **Custom components** feature allowing developers to import from the custom components marketplace or develop their own unique, user-defined building blocks with React for addressing specific requirements not covered by Qodly's default components.
- Introduced **Dialog component**, a window displaying additional content within the context of the existing page. Now, displaying popups containing various components and handling user actions is easier.
- Added standard action to set a qodlysource value.
- Enabled Navigation (current tab / new tab) driven by a String qodlysource containing a Page name or an external link.


<h3> Improvements </h3>

- Organized Page editor components by type: Container, Simple, List, and Custom Components.
- Added **Show borders** property to the properties panel of the datatable.
- Enhanced **Code editor** tab contextual menu with options to manage breakpoints.
- Displayed a warning for not saved Pages when previewing the app.
- Maintained the last active tab visible in the contextual panel when selecting a component.
- Removed **Index Kind** property availability for a Text attribute in Model Editor.
- Renamed **Actions Families** for consistency.
- Notified end-user upon connection loss.
