title: BLOB
---

A BLOB (Binary Large OBject) attribute, variable or expression is a contiguous series of bytes that can be treated as one whole object, or whose bytes can be addressed individually.

A blob is loaded into memory in its entirety. A blob variable is held and exists in memory only. A blob attribute is loaded into memory from the disk, like the rest of the entity to which it belongs. Like other attribute types that can retain a large amount of data (such as the picture type), blob attributes are not duplicated in memory when you modify an entity.

## Blob Types

Using the QodlyScript language, there are two ways to handle a blob:

- **as a scalar value**: a blob can be stored in a blob variable or attribute and altered.
- **as an object (`4D.Blob`)**: a `4D.Blob` is a blob object. You can encapsulate a blob or part of it in a `4D.Blob` without altering the original blob. This method is called [boxing](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_type_(object-oriented_programming)#Boxing>). For more info on how to instantiate a `4D.Blob`, see [Blob class](../BlobClass.md).

Each blob type has its advantages. Use the following table to determine which one suits your needs:

|                                      | Blob | 4D.Blob |
| ------------------------------------ | :--: | :-----: |
| Alterable                            | Yes  |   No    |
| Shareable in objects and collections |  No  |   Yes   |
| Passed by reference\*                |  No  |   Yes   |
| Performance when accessing bytes     |  +   |    -    |
| Maximum size                         | 2GB  | Memory  |

\*Unlike the QodlyScript commands designed to take a scalar blob as a parameter, passing a scalar blob to a method duplicates it in memory. When working with methods, using blob objects (`4D.Blob`) is more efficient, as they are passed by reference.

:::note

By default, the maximum size of scalar blobs is set to 2GB, but this size limit may be lower depending on the available space.

You cannot use operators on blobs.

## Checking if a variable holds a scalar blob or a `4D.Blob`

Use the [`valueType`](../commands/valueType.md) command to determine if a value is of type Blob or Object.

To check that an object is a blob object (`4D.Blob`), use [`instanceOf`](../commands/instanceOf.md):

```qs
var myBlob: blob
var myBlobObject: 4D.Blob
var is4DBlob: boolean
var type: integer
myBlobObject = 4D.Blob.new()

type = valueType(myblobObject) // 38 (object)
is4DBlob = instanceOf(myblobObject,4D.Blob) //True
```

## Passing blobs as parameters

You can pass a scalar blob or a `4D.Blob` to any QodlyScript command that takes a blob as a parameter:

```qs
var myBlob, myNewBlob: 4D.Blob
var myString: string
convertFromString("Hello, World!", "UTF-8", myBlob)
myString = convertToText(myBlob,"UTF-8")
 //myString contains "Hello, World!"
myNewBlob = myBlob.slice(0,5)
myString = convertToText(myNewBlob,"UTF-8")
 //myString contains "Hello"
```


You can pass blobs and blob objects (`4D.Blob`) to methods. Keep in mind that unlike blob objects, which are passed by reference, scalar blobs are duplicated in memory when passed to methods.



## Automatic conversion of blob type

QodlyScript automatically converts scalar blobs to blob objects, and vice versa, when they're assigned to each other. For example:

```qs
// Create a variable of type Blob and an object variable
var myBlob: blob
var myObject : object

// Assign that blob to a property of myObject named "blob"
myObject = newObject("blob",myBlob)

// The blob stored in myBlob is automatically converted to a 4D.Blob
var type : boolean
type = instanceOf(myObject.blob,4D.Blob)  //true

// Conversion from 4D.Blob to blob
myBlob = myObject.blob
type = valueType(myBlob) // blob
```

:::note

When converting a `4D.Blob` to a scalar blob, if the size of the `4D.Blob` exceeds the maximum size for scalar blobs, the resulting scalar blob is empty. For example, when the maximum size for scalar blobs is 2GB, if you convert a `4D.Blob` of 2.5GB to a scalar blob, you obtain an empty blob.

## Individually accessing bytes in a blob

#### Accessing a scalar blob's bytes

You can access individual bytes of a scalar blob using curly brackets `{}`. Within a blob, bytes are numbered from 0 to N-1, where N is the size of the blob:

```qs
  // Declare a variable of type Blob
var myBlob : blob
var byte : integer
convertFromText("Hello, World!", "UTF-8", myBlob)
byte = myBlob{1} //101 (character code for "e")

```

Since you can address all the bytes of a blob individually, you can store whatever you want in a Blob variable or attribute.

#### Accessing a `4D.Blob`'s bytes

Use square brackets `[]` to directly access a specific byte in a `4D.Blob`

```qs
var myBlob : 4D.Blob
var byte : integer
convertFromText("Hello, World!", "UTF-8", myBlob)
byte = myBlob[1] //101
```

Since a `4D.Blob` cannot be altered, you can read the bytes of a `4D.Blob` using this syntax, but not modify them.

## Modifying a scalar blob

Unlike blob objects, scalar blobs can be altered. For example:

```qs
var myBlob : blob
var myString : string
convertFromText("Hello, World!", "UTF-8", myBlob)
myBlob{1} = characterCode("A") //replace the 1st byte
myString = convertToText(myBlob,"UTF-8") //HAllo, World!
```
