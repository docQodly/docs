The **Icon** component is a UI element that displays graphical symbols or icons in web applications.


## Use Cases

The **Icon** component serves various purposes within user interfaces, including:

- **Action Indicators**: Icons are used to represent actions, such as "Save," "Delete," or "Print".

- **Navigation Enhancements**: Icons can be employed to enhance navigation by representing menu items, links, or categories.

- **Information Presentation**: Icons are utilized to visually convey information, such as alerts, warnings, or success messages.


## Properties Customization

Enhance the **Icon** component to align with your application's requirements using the following customization options:

<Column.List align="center" justifyContent="between">
	<Column.Item width="60%">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Icon</strong>: Select the desired icon from a predefined list of icons. </li>
        </ul>
	</Column.Item>
	<Column.Item width="30%">
         <img src={require('./img/button_icon.png').default} style={{borderRadius: '6px'}} />
	</Column.Item>
</Column.List>


## Data Integration

When it comes to data-binding, it's important to note that the **Icon** component itself is not inherently data-bound. Unlike components like the **DataTable** that derive their content from specified qodlysources, the main purpose of the **Icon** component is to provide a visual representation.


## Triggers and Events

The **Icon** component can respond to various events, enabling dynamic user experiences. Events that can trigger actions within the component include:

|Event|Description|

|On Click| Calls for an action when the user clicks on the component. |
|On Keyup| Calls for an action when a keyboard key is released while the component is in focus|
