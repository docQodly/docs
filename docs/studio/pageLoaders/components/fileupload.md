## Properties Customization

### File Upload Component

Enhance the **File Upload** component to align with your application's requirements using the following customization options:

<Column.List align="center" justifyContent="between">
	<Column.Item width="60%">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Label</strong>: Personalize the label to offer clear instructions or guidance.</li>
        </ul>
	</Column.Item>

            <li><strong>Icon Position</strong>: Choose the position of the icon in relation to the label, allowing options for top, bottom, left, right, or even hidden.</li>
        </ul>
	</Column.Item>
	<Column.Item width="35%">
                <img src={require('./img/fileUpload_IconPosition.png').default} style={{borderRadius: '6px'}} />
	</Column.Item>
</Column.List>

<Column.List align="center" justifyContent="between">

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Size Limit</strong>: Define the maximum file size users are allowed to upload. Choose from units such as KB, MB, and GB. <br/></li>
			If a user attempts to upload a file exceeding the specified size, an error message is displayed in the browser.
        </ul>
	</Column.Item>
	<Column.Item width="35%">
                <img src={require('./img/fileUpload_SizeLimit.png').default} style={{borderRadius: '6px'}} />
				<img src={require('./img/fileUpload_SizLimitError.png').default} style={{borderRadius: '6px'}} />
	</Column.Item>
</Column.List>

<Column.List align="center" justifyContent="between">
	<Column.Item width="60%">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Media Type</strong>: Specify the supported file types that can be uploaded using the component. Supported types include text, image, video, and audio.</li>
        </ul>
	</Column.Item>
	<Column.Item width="35%">
                <img src={require('./img/fileUpload_MediaType.png').default} style={{borderRadius: '6px'}} />
	</Column.Item>
</Column.List>


### Embedded Icon

Within the **File Upload** component, an embedded **Icon** allows for further customization of the following properties: 

<Column.List align="center" justifyContent="between">
	<Column.Item width="60%">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Icon</strong>: When the icon visibility is configured in the File Upload component's customization properties, you can select an icon from an icon picker list.</li>
        </ul>
	</Column.Item>
	<Column.Item width="30%">
            <img src={require('./img/button_icon.png').default} style={{borderRadius: '6px'}} />
	</Column.Item>
</Column.List>

## Data Integration

The **File Upload** component uses data-binding to link user interactions with the underlying data structure.

:::info 
The qodlysource for the **File Upload** component can take the form of either a `Blob` or a `Picture`.
:::

### Data Binding

<Column.List align="center" justifyContent="between">
	<Column.Item width="60%">
		Bind the component to an attribute of Blob or Picture type within an entity qodlysource. This specific attribute will serve as the storage location for the uploaded file.
	</Column.Item>
	<Column.Item width="35%">
        <img src={require('./img/fileUpload_dataBinding.png').default} style={{borderRadius: '6px'}} />
	</Column.Item>
</Column.List>

:::tip 
Alternatively, you can establish the connection by dragging and dropping the qodlysource onto the File Upload component.
:::

## Example: Sending the File and File Name

To send both a file and its name to the database, the File Upload component must be bound to a Picture field (e.g., imageEntity.Content) within an entity. However, to capture the file name along with the file itself, you must also reference the entity in the action that handles the file upload.

For example, in the "Send" button of your form, you can use a function with two parameters:

uploadImage(imageEntity, imageEntity.Content)

To implement this, your function should retrieve the picture from imageEntity.Content and the file name from the object (e.g., OB Get($oImage; "path")), then save both to a new entity instance.

## Showcase

Here's a glimpse of how the **File Upload** component will look and behave in action:

<img src={require('./img/fileUpload_Preview.gif').default} style={{borderRadius: '6px', height: '90%', width: '90%'}} />
