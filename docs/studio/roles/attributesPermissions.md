## Purpose and Scope

**Attribute** permissions enable you to control access to specific attributes within dataclasses. These permissions dictate what actions users are allowed to perform on individual attributes, providing fine-grained access control over your data.

## Configuring Attribute Permissions 

**Attribute**-level permissions can override or supplement those set at the dataclass level. To set attribute permissions for a specific privilege:

- Select the resource name, like the `netProfitMargin` in the `Reporting` dataclass, from the dropdown list.
- Or, type the resource name directly into the search bar.

## Example: Attribute-Level Access Control

While **Dataclass** permissions cascade down to attributes, you can adapt them by overriding or supplementing permissions as needed.

For instance, the `ManageReports` privilege, assigned to users with the `Sales Manager` role, allows unrestricted access to the `Reporting` Dataclass. 

<img src={require('./img/ManageReports.png').default} style={{borderRadius: '6px'}} />

However, this inadvertently exposes sensitive data, such as `netProfitMargin` and `totalExpenses` attributes, to individuals outside the financial department. Consider a scenario where a user with a `Sales Manager` role attempts an HTTP request to the `netProfitMargin` attribute REST API endpoint. This unchecked access permits unauthorized viewing of confidential financial data:

<img src={require('./img/attributePermissions1.png').default} style={{borderRadius: '6px'}} />

To address this issue, refine the attribute permissions to restrict access to sensitive attributes:

<img src={require('./img/overriddingDataclass.png').default} style={{borderRadius: '6px'}} />

<br/><br/>

By setting attribute permissions in the `ManageFinancials` privilege, you allow users with the `ManageReports` privilege to access the Reporting dataclass while restricting access to confidential attributes like `netProfitMargin` and `totalExpenses`.

<img src={require('./img/attributePermissions2.png').default} style={{borderRadius: '6px'}} />

In the response, the presence of `__INVALID: 1` indicates that the attribute is marked as invalid, signaling that the user lacks the necessary permissions to access or modify it.
