With the presence of the `Guest` privilege, which grants read access to the entire **Datastore**, users without assigned roles have unrestricted access to resources. This emphasizes the necessity of refining the scope of this privilege, a process that includes adjusting **Dataclasses** permissions.

## Understanding DataClass Permissions 

**DataClass** Permissions empower you with the ability to shape and control access to specific **DataClasses** within your **Datastore**. These permissions dictate what actions and interactions users are allowed to perform on individual **DataClasses**.


## Setting DataClass Permissions 

**DataClass**-level permissions hold the power to override or supplement those set at the **DataStore** level. To set DataClass permissions:

- Choose the resource name, like the `Employee` dataclass, from the dropdown list.
- Alternatively, type the resource name, such as `Employee` dataclass, directly into the search bar.

## Hierarchy and Overrides 

Expanding on the [second solution](datastorePermissions#2nd-solution-full-access-to-gradual-restriction), it starts by granting the `Guest` privilege initial read access to the entire **Datastore** before gradually restricting access to other resources through **DataClass** permissions, excluding the `Guest` privilege from specific **Dataclasses**.

While **Datastore** permissions cascade down to more specific **Dataclasses** levels, they retain flexibility. These permissions can be overridden or supplemented as needed, offering a dynamic approach to access control.

Setting DataClass permissions in the `Restricted` privilege grants the `Guest` privilege the freedom to explore the Datastore while restricting access to confidential resources.

Here, the inheritance of privileges set at the DataStore level ( `Guest` ) is overridden by the `Restricted` privilege. As a result, those with a `Guest` role no longer have access to the `Employee` dataclass.

A similar approach applies to confidential Reporting documents and Bookings. The `ManageReports` privilege is granted total permissions for the `Reporting` resource, and `ManageBookings` similarly gains full control over the `Booking` resource. 

## Model Editor Approach

Using the **Model Editor**, configure Dataclass permissions by linking privileges to permissions like `create`, `read`, `update`, and `delete`. This interface empowers control over entity operations within specific **Dataclasses**. 

Permissions management for the **Dataclasses** becomes straightforward through the Model Editor's streamlined dropdown selection, allowing easy allocation of desired privileges.
