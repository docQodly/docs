The concept of rendering plays a fundamental role in bringing digital interfaces to life. However, Qodly Studio has a unique approach to rendering that sets it apart from traditional methods.


## What is Rendering?

At its core, rendering represents the pivotal stage where the abstract blueprint of a digital interface takes its final form. It encompasses the intricate process of translating design layouts, data connections, and interactive behaviors into a visually appealing and functional user interface that end-users can interact with.


## Understanding the Qodly Approach

In the case of Qodly Studio, rendering takes a different path compared to conventional web development. Here's how it works:

- **Design and Configuration**: Users initiate the webform creation process within **Qodly Studio** by arranging components, mapping datasources to these components, and configuring event-driven behaviors. This design phase captures the form's layout and desired functionality.

- **JSON Representation**: Instead of generating conventional HTML code, **Qodly Studio** encapsulates the entire webform, including layout, data connections, and event-driven logic, in a structured JSON file. This JSON file serves as the representation of the webform.

- **Rendering Trigger**: Accessing the webform directly in a web browser is not an option. Instead, the webform is "**rendered**" when users initiate the rendering process, which can be done in one of two ways:

    - **Preview in the Studio**: Users have the option to [preview the webform within the Qodly Studio interface](#preview-in-the-studio).

    - **Dedicated Browser Tab**: Alternatively, users can opt to [render the webform in a separate browser tab](#preview-in-a-browser-window).



When a webform is rendered for the end user, what is returned is the final HTML code and CSS that represent the webform's visual appearance and functionality.

The webform is transformed into an HTML/CSS representation that can be displayed and interacted with in a web browser. JSON is used internally for data representation and configuration but is not what the end user receives when viewing the webform.

## Runtime Rendering

At **runtime**, webforms are generated and interpreted by the built-in renderer engine. This engine takes the JSON representation and transforms it into a functional, interactive form that end-users can engage with.


## Unique Webform URLs

Crucially, each webform is assigned a **unique URL** on the Qodly Web server. These URLs serve as access points for end-users to interact with and render the webforms they require.


## Data Flow and Server Architecture

The flow of data within the Qodly Studio ecosystem is carefully orchestrated, ensuring a seamless rendering experience:

<img alt="explorer" src={require('./img/workflow.png').default} style={{borderRadius: '6px'}} />

- Qodly Studio operates with an embedded Studio web server, providing secure web access. Users can conveniently preview webforms within the protected confines of Qodly Studio.

- Additionally, the Qodly web server functions as a REST server, facilitating communication between the rendering engine and the web server through REST requests.

- After deployment, webforms become readily accessible to end-users, who can render and interact with them directly in their web browsers.


## Webform Rendering Options

Rendering a webform in Qodly Studio provides versatile control and accessibility. You can preview it in the Studio or a separate browser window, but It's important to note that:

Database resource access control depends on the chosen rendering method.

### Preview in the Studio

<Column.List align="center" justifyContent="between">
    <Column.Item width="75%">
        This option enables you to render the current page directly within the webform editor window. Here, the webform is rendered by the Qodly Studio's embedded web server. <br/><br/>
        This approach provides a comprehensive view of data classes, functions, and attributes, even if they are not exposed as REST resources.
    </Column.Item>
    <Column.Item width="20%">
        <img alt="explorer" src={require('./img/preview-ide.png').default} style={{borderRadius: '6px', height: '70%', width: '70%'}} />
    </Column.Item>
</Column.List>

<br/>

Please keep in mind that:

:::info 
This preview is conducted with **Administrative** privileges, utilizing the **Admin** account you registered with. To conduct a preview based on a specific user's perspective, explore the options for **Previewing in a new tab** or **Previewing the entire site**.
:::


### Preview in a Browser Window

You have the flexibility to render the current webform or the entire website in a browser window. In both scenarios, the webform is rendered by the Qodly web renderer engine. This engine diligently applies **REST resource restrictions and permission actions** defined in your Qodly project, ensuring that only exposed resources are rendered in the browser. 

It's worth noting that:

:::info 
This preview operates under the logged-in user's privileges. During your initial preview or when your session expires, your browser will prompt you to log in with a Qodly user account, utilizing this account's privileges for rendering your application.
:::


#### Preview Webform in a New Tab

<Column.List align="center" justifyContent="between">
    <Column.Item width="75%">
        This option allows you to display the current webform in a browser window tab, offering a convenient way to assess its appearance and functionality.
    </Column.Item>
    <Column.Item width="20%">
        <img alt="explorer" src={require('./img/preview-tab.png').default} style={{borderRadius: '6px', height: '70%', width: '70%'}} />
    </Column.Item>
</Column.List>


#### Preview the Entire Site

<Column.List align="center" justifyContent="between">
    <Column.Item width="75%">
        The <code>Preview</code> button on the Qodly toolbar presents the start page, as <a href="./settings#application">defined in the Settings</a> within a browser window tab. This option provides a holistic view of the application's initial landing page.
    </Column.Item>
    <Column.Item width="20%">
        <img alt="explorer" src={require('./img/preview-main.png').default} style={{borderRadius: '6px', height: '70%', width: '70%'}} />
    </Column.Item>
</Column.List>

:::info

If you click on the **Preview** button while there are unsaved changes in your forms, they will not be taken into account for the rendering. A pop over warns you about it:

![preview-pop-over](img/preview-pop.png)

You can disable this pop over display by selecting the "Memorize..." option at the bottom of the window. You can also control the option through the [**Show Unsaved Files Pop Over** user settings option](settings.md#show-unsaved-files-pop-over).
