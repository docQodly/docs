title: Creating an Application
---

Here are the main steps in creating a Qodly application:

1. [Clone](../console/consoleOverview.md#managing-applications) an existing app by clicking on "Clone" or start a new app and choose an [application template](../console/myApps.md#creating-a-new-application).
2. [Set Up App Details](../console/myApps.md#step-3-configure-application-details): Enter the project name, description, and other details.
3. Choose the [resources](../console/myApps.md#environment-configuration) you need for your development environment.
4. Add your [billing details](../console/myApps.md#step-4-finalize-billing). You can add your own card or invite someone else to add theirs.
5. Subscribe.
6. Your development environment is installed. You can [go to Studio](../4DQodlyPro/overview.md) and start building your app.
7. A welcome tour will begin for a quick overview of Qodly Studio.
8. Start from the frontend by [dragging and dropping components](../4DQodlyPro/pageLoaders/pageLoaderOverview.md) (or widgets) or use [pre-made templates](../4DQodlyPro/pageLoaders/templates.md). Alternatively, begin by preparing your data using the [Data Model](../4DQodlyPro/model/model-editor-interface.md), [code](../4DQodlyPro/coding.md) your functions, and then bind them with [Qodly Sources](../4DQodlyPro/pageLoaders/qodlySources.md) to the frontend.
9. Manage [roles and privileges](../4DQodlyPro/roles/rolesPrivilegesOverview.md) in the editor.
10. Your app is ready for [testing](../4DQodlyPro/pageLoaders/pageLoaderOverview.md#preview) or [deployment](../console/releaseManagementDeployment.md).
