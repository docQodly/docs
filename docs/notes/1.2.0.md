## Qodly Studio

<h3>What's new</h3>

- [Qodly Looker Studio Connector](../qodlyLookerStudio/qodlyLookerStudioConnector): Added integration between Qodly applications and Google Looker Studio, enabling users to create interactive dashboards, track real-time business metrics, and generate custom reports using Qodly data.

- [Built-in Shared Qodly Namespace](../studio/pageLoaders/qodlySources.md#built-in-shared-qodly-namespace): Introduced a built-in Qodly namespace available across all application pages. It provides ready-to-use qodlysources for shared data handling, including a [Location](../studio/pageLoaders/qodlySources.md#qodlysource-location) datasource that simplifies working with URL segments, query parameters, and anchors.

- [Saved Condition Go To Button](../studio/pageLoaders/states/conditionalState.md#saved-condition-integration): When a saved condition is integrated into a state, a **Go to** button now appears next to its name. Clicking it opens the full saved condition in edit mode—so you can quickly review or update it without leaving the schema view.

- [Interval Range Validation for Text Input](../studio/pageLoaders/components/textinput.md#intervals-for-date-input): For text inputs using the **interval type `Range`**, if the **start date is later than the end date**, an error message will be shown and the dates will be temporarily disabled until corrected. 

- [Matrix Selection Behavior Options](../studio/pageLoaders/components/matrix.md#properties-customization): You can now control how the **Matrix** behaves after a data update (like reloading or filtering).

- [Debugger Sidebar](../studio/debugging.md#debugger-sidebar): A new sidebar in the code editor lets you monitor, group, enable/disable, delete, and jump to breakpoints across your entire app. It also shows a [Variables panel](../studio/debugging.md#variables-panel) during debug sessions, so you can view local variables, current line variables, and method arguments—all in one place.


<h3> Improvements </h3> 

- **Renamed properties in the [intervals datasource](../studio/pageLoaders/components/textinput.md#params-object-properties)** of the text input component for consistency:

    - `toDay` is now `today`
    - `startingfrom` is now `startingFrom`
    - `untilto` is now `until`

- **Include Option and Interval Card Toggle**: Added visual controls to improve interval management. The [Include checkbox](../studio/pageLoaders/components/textinput.md#include-checkbox-within-the-card) lets users include or exclude specific date ranges, while the [card toggle](../studio/pageLoaders/components/textinput.md#card-toggle-top-right) allows enabling or disabling intervals without losing their configuration.
