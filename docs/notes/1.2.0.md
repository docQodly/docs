## Qodly Studio

<h3>What's new</h3>

- [Qodly Looker Studio Connector](../qodlyLookerStudio/qodlyLookerStudioConnector): Added integration between Qodly applications and Google Looker Studio, enabling users to create interactive dashboards, track real-time business metrics, and generate custom reports using Qodly data.

<h3> Improvements </h3> 

- Renamed properties in the [intervals datasource](../studio/pageLoaders/components/textinput.md#params-object-properties) of the text input component for consistency:

    - `toDay` is now `today`
    - `startingfrom` is now `startingFrom`
    - `untilto` is now `until`
