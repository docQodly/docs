## Qodly Studio

<h3> What's New </h3>

- Import from the UI components' catalog or develop your own component with the new **Custom components** feature: documentation and API released.
- New [**Dialog component**](https://github.com/docQodly/docs/edit/main/docs/studio/design-webforms/components/dialog.md): a window displaying additional content within the context of the existing page. Thanks to this, it is now so easy to display popups containing various components and handling user actions.
- [Datasources](https://github.com/docQodly/docs/edit/main/docs/studio/design-webforms/events.md#L262) - New standard action to set a datasource value.
- [Navigation](https://github.com/docQodly/docs/edit/main/docs/studio/design-webforms/events.md#L317) - Navigation (current tab / new tab) can be driven by a String datasource containing a web form name or an external link.

<h3> Improvements </h3>

- Form editor - [New component organization](https://github.com/docQodly/docs/edit/main/docs/studio/design-webforms/components/componentsBasics.md#L13). They are categorized by type: Container, Simple, List, and Custom Components
- Styling datatable - A new [**Show borders**](https://github.com/docQodly/docs/edit/main/docs/studio/design-webforms/components/datatable.md#L52) property is available.
- [Code editor](https://docqodly.github.io/docs/studio/debugging#managing-breakpoints): Tab contextual menu: add options to remove break points in the current file, in other files or in all files.
- [Show a warning](https://docqodly.github.io/docs/studio/settings#user) for not saved webforms when [previewing the app](https://docqodly.github.io/docs/studio/rendering#preview-the-entire-site)

- [Components](https://github.com/docQodly/docs/edit/main/docs/studio/design-webforms/create-webform.md#L160) - Show the last active tab in the contextual panel when selecting a component.

- Model Editor - Index Kind property shouldn't be available for an attribute of type Text.
- Actions - For more consistence, actions families have been renamed.

- Inform the end-user when connection is lost.
