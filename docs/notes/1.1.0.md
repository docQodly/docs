## Qodly Studio

<h3>What's new</h3>

- [Reveal Password Icon Placement](../studio/pageLoaders/components/textinput#embedded-input): Added an option to position the reveal password icon on either the left or right side of the text input field.

- [Week Start Customization in Date Picker](../studio/pageLoaders/components/textinput#embedded-input): Added support for selecting the starting day of the week in the date picker.

- [Intervals for Date Input](../studio/pageLoaders/components/textinput#embedded-input): Added support for defining date selection intervals, enabling restrictions such as start/end dates, specific date ranges, or day-based selection. Users can manually set intervals or bind a datasource for dynamic control.

- [Validation Rule for Qodly Source Selection](../studio/pageLoaders/states/conditionalState#saved-condition): Enforced a validation rule that allows only shared Qodly sources in Saved Conditions. Selecting a local Qodly source triggers a sanity check error with a clear message and visual indicators to prevent misconfiguration.

- [Clear Non-Existing Resources](../studio/roles/permissionsOverview#clear-non-existing-resources): Added a visual indicator for unavailable resources in the permissions table. Non-existing resources now appear in red with a shadow effect, and a Clear button is enabled to remove all associated permissions.

- [Privileges Contextual Panel](../studio/roles/overview#privileges-contextual-panel): Added a contextual panel for privileges, providing a clear visual representation of privilege relationships. The panel updates dynamically based on the selected privilege, highlighting inherited relationships and allowing seamless navigation.

- [Template UX Improvements](../studio/pageLoaders/templates): Improved template selection UX by increasing spacing between templates, making them easier to distinguish, especially for first-time users.

- [QodlyEvents Class Interface](../studio/qodlyEventsClass): Added structured support for defining automatic startup and shutdown logic within the QodlyEvents class.

- [Flexbox Direction Options](../studio/pageLoaders/styling#properties-panel-styling-options): Added "Row Reverse" & "Column Reverse" options to the Direction property If the Display is Flex, allowing items to be arranged in reverse order.

- [Support for HTTP Handlers](../studio/httpHandlers): Added support for defining and managing HTTP Handlers to process requests based on URL patterns and HTTP methods, with a new UI and code editor integration. Request handlers must be implemented in a [shared](../language/basics/lang-classes.md#shared-singleton) [singleton class](../language/basics/lang-classes.md#singleton-classes), supporting [4D.IncomingMessage](../language/IncomingMessageClass) for request details and [4D.OutgoingMessage](../language/OutgoingMessageClass) for structured responses.

- [New Event in Selectbox Component](../studio/pageLoaders/components/selectbox#triggers-and-events): Added the On Clear event, which triggers an action when the selected item is cleared.

- [Iterator Qodly Source ($This) Action Support](../studio/pageLoaders/events/bindingActionToEvents#qodly-sources): Added support for Drop and Copy as the only available actions when using an iterator Qodly Source ($This) in the events panel of a standard action.

- [New onInit Event for Qodly Sources](../studio/pageLoaders/events/overview#on-init): Added a distinct `On Init` event for Qodly Sources, which triggers when a Qodly Source is instantiated by the renderer. This allows developers to set up an initial value for a Qodly Source without interference from subsequent `On Change` events.


## Qodly Server

<h3> What's New </h3>

- New [4D.IncomingMessage](../language/IncomingMessageClass.md) class, allowing to process contents retrieved from custom HTTP Request handlers.

- Added the [`logEvent`](../language/commands/logEvent.md) command, allowing you to write custom events in the [diagnostic log file](../cloud/resourceMonitoring.md#logs-tab).

- Added the [QodlyEvents](../language/QodlyEvents) class, providing a structured approach to handling application lifecycle events in a Qodly Server environment. Includes lifecycle functions like [.onStartup()](../language/QodlyEvents#onstartup) and [.onStop()](../language/QodlyEvents#onstop) to execute logic during server startup and shutdown.

- Added the [Endpoints](../language/EndpointsClass) class, simplifying access to system endpoints, including public and authenticated API endpoints.

- Introduced the `.me` property, which provides direct access to the current instance of the [Users](../language/UsersClass#me), [Endpoints](../language/EndpointsClass#me) and [QodlyEvents](../language/QodlyEvents) singletons.

    :::warning
    While existing instantiation using cs.Qodly.Users.new() remains functional for backward compatibility, we no longer recommend using it.
    :::

- Renamed functions for improved clarity:

    - .getCurrentUser() → [.currentUser()](../language/UsersClass#allusers)
    - .getAllUsers() → [.allUsers()](../language/UsersClass#currentuser)
    
    :::warning
    The old syntax is still supported for compatibility but will be deprecated over time. We recommend transitioning to the new syntax.
    :::

- New [4D.TCPConnection](../language/TCPConnectionClass.md) and [4D.TCPEvent](../language/TCPEventClass.md) classes to handle low-level TCP connections. 


<h3> Improvements </h3> 

- Updated [**Operator precedence rules**](../language/basics/lang-operators.md#operator-precedence) to align more closely with programming standards.
- Enhanced the [`.sign()`](../language/CryptoKeyClass.md#sign) and [`.verify()`](../language/CryptoKeyClass.md#verify) functions in the [4D.CryptoKey class](../language/CryptoKeyClass.md) to support Blob data in the *message* parameter.
