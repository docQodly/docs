**<span  style={{color:'#B174E5'}}>QDLER</span>** reporting in! Ready to unleash the full potential of our web application with the incredible power of the [**Components**](#) section - the driving force behind it all. With three supercharged sub-elements, we can create a dynamic user experience that's as impactful as a team of superheroes fighting off their enemies!!

<br />

First up, we have **<span  style={{color:'#B174E5'}}>Components</span>**. This element lets you search and choose from a wide range of components that can be added to your canvas. Once added, you have the flexibility to customize the appearance and behavior of the component and link it to a data source. Think of it as having your own data analysis tool, providing valuable insights to help you make informed decisions and deliver precision solutions.

Next, we have **<span style={{color:'#B174E5'}}>Crafted Components</span>**, you can think of it as your very own design lab! You can design and style a perfect component or a group of components and save them for future use with a simple drag and drop. With the Copy and Paste feature, you can reuse your hard work without wasting time - just like how Ant-Man uses his shrinking powers to outsmart his enemies.

Last but not least, we have **<span style={{color:'#B174E5'}}>Templates</span>** a convenient starting point for creating web pages, just like having a reliable tool at your disposal. **Qodly Studio** provides pre-designed pages that you can easily customize according to your preferences. Simply drag and drop the templates onto the canvas, and you're ready to go! These templates are an excellent way to get familiar with the structure of webforms, and you can easily modify the content to make it your own.
