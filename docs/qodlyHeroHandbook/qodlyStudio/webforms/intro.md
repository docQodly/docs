With the ability to easily map data using ORDA data classes and execute **<span style={{color:'#B174E5'}}>QodlyScript</span>** code on web events or datasource events, the possibilities are endless.

<br />

The first step in **<span style={{color:'#B174E5'}}>Qodly Studio</span>** is always to create a **<span style={{color:'#B174E5'}}>Webform</span>**, which serves as the container for all other components. To get started, simply go to the `homepage` and click on `Webform` to enter a name for your new webform. Alternatively, you can click on the `+ New` tab, followed by `Webform`.

Let me walk you through the essential tools that come with creating a webform. These tools will enable you to customize your application's interface and content to meet your specific requirements.

<br />

Firstly, we have **<span style={{color:'#B174E5'}}>Components</span>**, which is designed to help you build smart UI. These components can be easily dragged and dropped onto the canvas, and some of them are containers that allow you to nest other components or containers inside them. This makes it easier for you to visually design and organize your webforms.

Next, we have **<span style={{color:'#B174E5'}}>Datasources</span>**, where you can handle data on your webforms. From the Catalog to remote and local datasources.

The **<span style={{color:'#B174E5'}}>Style Library</span>** is another essential tool that lets you customize your UI design by managing your own CSS classes and applying them to components.

Finally, we have the **<span style={{color:'#B174E5'}}>Outline</span>** tool that lets you navigate your webform components with ease. The Outline tool makes it easy to move through the component hierarchy of your current webform.
