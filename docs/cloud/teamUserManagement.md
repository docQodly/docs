## Overview

The **Team** tab in Qodly enables you to manage user access within each environment, allowing for efficient collaboration with defined roles and permissions. Here’s how the Team tab works:

## Adding Users

To add a user to the environment:

1. Click the **Add User** button on the right.
2. Choose to either **Select from existing users** or **Add a new user**.

   - **Select from existing users**: Pick a user who has previously been added to other environments or applications.
   - **New user**: If the user is not yet registered in the application, select this option to add their details manually.

3. When adding a new user, provide the following details:
   - **Email address**: Required email address for inviting the user.
   - **First Name** and **Last Name**: Helps in identifying the user.
   - **Profile**: Choose the user’s profile based on the roles defined in your Qodly application. By default, the profile is set to Admin, but you can select other roles as defined in your app.

4. Click **Submit** to finalize the addition. The user will receive an invitation to access the environment.

## Managing Users

Once users are added, they are listed in the **Team** tab with columns for **First Name**, **Last Name**, **Email**, and **Profile**. For each user, you have the following actions available:

- **Edit User**: Click the edit icon to update the user's information, including changing their role. After making changes, click **Update** to confirm. This is useful for modifying a user’s access level or correcting details.

- **Delete User**: Click the delete icon to remove the user from the environment. A confirmation dialog will appear, prompting you to confirm the deletion to avoid accidental removal.

## Filtering Users

The Team tab includes a **Find User** search field, allowing you to quickly locate specific users by name or email. This feature is particularly helpful in larger teams where managing multiple users can become challenging.
