Here are the main steps in creating a Qodly application:

1. [Clone](../cloud/consoleOverview.md#managing-applications) an existing app by clicking on "Clone" or start a new app and choose an [application template](../cloud/myApps.md#creating-a-new-application).
2. [Set Up App Details](../cloud/myApps.md#step-3-configure-application-details): Enter the project name, description, and other details.
3. Choose the [resources](../cloud/myApps.md#environment-configuration) you need for your development environment.
4. Add your [billing details](../cloud/myApps.md#step-4-finalize-billing). You can add your own card or invite someone else to add theirs.
5. Subscribe.
6. Your development environment is installed. You can [go to Studio](../studio/overview.md) and start building your app.
7. A welcome tour will begin for a quick overview of the studio.
8. Start from the frontend by [dragging and dropping components](../studio/pageLoaders/pageLoaderOverview.md) (or widgets) or use [pre-made templates](../studio/pageLoaders/templates.md). Alternatively, begin by preparing your data using the [Data Model](../studio/model/model-editor-interface.md), [code](../studio/coding.md) your functions, and then bind them with [Qodly Sources](../studio/pageLoaders/qodlySources.md) to the frontend.
9. Manage [roles and privileges](../studio/roles/rolesPrivilegesOverview.md) in the editor.
10. Your app is ready for [testing](../studio/pageLoaders/pageLoaderOverview.md#preview) or [deployment](../cloud/deployment.md).
