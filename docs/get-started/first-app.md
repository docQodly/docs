Here are the main steps in creating a Qodly application:

1. Clone an existing app by clicking on "Clone" or start a new app and choose an application template.
2. Set Up App Details: Enter the project name, description, and other details.
3. Choose the resources you need for your development environment.
4. Add your billing details. You can add your own card or invite someone else to add theirs.
5. Subscribe.
6. Your development environment is installed. You can go to Studio and start building your app.
7. A welcome tour will begin for a quick overview of the studio.
8. Start from the frontend by dragging and dropping components (or widgets) or use pre-made templates. Alternatively, begin by preparing your data using the Data Model, code your functions, and then bind them with Qodly Sources to the frontend.
9. Manage roles and privileges in the editor.
10. Your app is ready for testing or deployment.
