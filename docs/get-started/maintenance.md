title: Qodly updates and versioning
---

Qodly uses Semantic versioning (also known as SemVer) with the format (Major.Minor.Patch).

<b>Major Release</b>
<br>A major release brings significant changes to Qodly, posing potential risks to your application. Verify compatibility before upgrading is highly recommended. 
These updates are made every one or two years and include core changes such as the evolution of Orda or Qodly Script, the addition of new technology, and significant changes in Qodly Server. 

<br>We support two major releases at a time.

<b>Minor Releases</b>
<br>A minor release introduces new features that enhance productivity and efficiency, resulting in a second number increment.

<b>Patch Releases</b>
<br>A patch release fixes bugs without adding new features, incrementing the third number.
