## Pricing Model

The pricing model in Qodly is simple and flexible. It is based on the environment, the configuration of the environment, and the data transferred to the internet.

Fixed price plan by environment includes standard settings for power, storage, and a pack of internet data. The price per environment increases if you upgrade the power or storage. At the beginning of the next month, we will calculate the data transferred, and you will be billed for any overage data consumed.

If you can estimate your data usage in advance, we recommend upgrading your data plan. The cost per GB is lower, which will save you money. You can decrease the plan at any time.

## Subscription & Upgrade (coming soon)

Once you created your new application, on the [Subscription page](../cloud/billingSubscriptionManagement.md), you can manage all your subscriptions, including creating new environments, upgrading, or deleting them. It provides a global view for each application.

The billing cycle starts at the beginning of the month. Depending on the day you subscribe or upgrade, the difference will be calculated and invoiced.

## Downgrade (coming soon)

## Cancelation

You can cancel at any time in any environment, except the development one, or even cancel the entire application. Your subscription is canceled immediately.
