title: Shared objects and collections
---

**Shared objects** and **shared collections** are specific [objects](lang-object.md) and [collections](lang-collection.md) whose contents are shared between processes. Shared objects and shared collections are compatible with **preemptive processes**: they can be passed by reference as parameters to commands such as `callWorker`.

Shared objects and shared collections can be stored in standard `object` and `collection` type [variables](lang-variables.md), but must be instantiated using specific commands:

- to create a shared object, use the [`newSharedObject`](../commands/newSharedObject.md) command or call the [`new()`](../ClassClass.md#new) function of a [shared class](lang-classes.md#shared-classes),
- to create a shared collection, use the [`newSharedCollection`](../commands/newSharedCollection.md) command.

Shared objects and collections can only contain scalar values or other shared objects and collections. However, shared objects and collections can be set as properties of standard (not shared) objects or collections.

In order to modify a shared object/collection, the **use...end** structure must be called. Reading a shared object/collection value does not require **use...end**.

To know if an object or a collection is shared, use the [`objectIsShared`](../commands/objectIsShared.md) command.

A unique, global catalog returned by the [`storage`](../commands/storage.md) command is always available throughout the project, and can be used to store all shared objects and collections.

## Using shared objects or collections

Once instantiated with the `newSharedObject` or `newSharedCollection` command, shared object/collection properties and elements can be modified or read from any process of the application.

### Modification

Modifications can be applied to shared objects and shared collections:

- adding or removing object properties,
- adding or editing values (provided they are supported in shared objects), including other shared objects or collections (which creates a shared group, see below).

:::note

Keep in mind that objects or collections set as the content of a shared object or collection must themselves be shared.

:::


However, all modification instructions in a shared object or collection must be surrounded by the `use...end` keywords, otherwise an error is generated.

```qs
s_obj = newSharedObject("prop1","alpha")
use(s_obj)
   s_obj.prop1 = "omega"
end
```

A shared object/collection can only be modified by one process at a time. `use` locks the shared object/collection from other threads, while `end` unlocks the shared object/collection (if the locking counter is at 0, see below). Trying to modify a shared object/collection without at least one `use...end` generates an error. When a process calls `use...end` on a shared object/collection that is already in use by another process, it is simply put on hold until the `end` unlocks it (no error is generated). Consequently, instructions within `use...end` structures should execute quickly and unlock the elements as soon as possible. Thus, it is strongly advised to avoid modifying a shared object or collection directly from the interface, e.g. through a Page.

Assigning shared objects/collections to properties or elements of other shared objects/collections is allowed and creates **shared groups**. A shared group is automatically created when a shared object/collection is set as property value or element of another shared object/collection. Shared groups allow nesting shared objects and collections but enforce additional rules:

- Calling `use` on a shared object/collection belonging to a group locks properties/elements of all shared objects/collections of the group and increments its locking counter. Calling `end` decrements the locking counter of the group and when the counter is at 0, all the linked shared objects/collections are unlocked.
- A shared object/collection can only belong to one shared group. An error is returned if you try to set an already grouped shared object/collection to a different group.
- Grouped shared objects/collections cannot be ungrouped. Once included in a shared group, a shared object/collection is linked permanently to that group during the whole session. Even if all references of an object/collection are removed from the parent object/collection, they will remain linked.

Please refer to example 2 for an illustration of shared group rules.

:::info

Shared groups are managed through an internal property named *locking identifier*.

### Read

Reading properties or elements of a shared object/collection is allowed without having to call the `use...end` structure, even if the shared object/collection is in use by another process.

However, it is necessary to read a shared object/collection within `use...end` when several values are linked together and must be read at once, for consistency reasons.

### Duplication

Calling [`objectCopy`](../commands/objectCopy.md) with a shared object or with an object containing shared object(s) as properties is possible, but will return a standard (not shared) object including its contained objects (if any).

### Storage

**storage** is a unique shared object, automatically available on each project. This shared object is returned by the [`storage`](../commands/storage.md) command. You can use this object to reference all shared objects/collections defined during the session that you want to be available from any preemptive or standard processes.

Note that, unlike standard shared objects, the **storage** object does not create a shared group when shared objects/collections are added as its properties. This exception allows the **storage** object to be used without locking all connected shared objects or collections.

For more information, refer to the [`storage` command description](../commands/storage.md).

## use...end

The formal syntax of the `use...end` structure is:

```qs
 use(Shared_object_or_Shared_collection)
    statement(s)
 end
```

The `use...end` structure defines a sequence of statements that will execute tasks on the *Shared_object_or_Shared_collection* parameter under the protection of an internal semaphore. *Shared_object_or_Shared_collection* can be any valid shared object or shared collection.

Shared objects and shared collections are designed to allow communication between processes, in particular, **preemptive processes**. They can be passed by reference as parameters from a process to another one. Surrounding modifications on shared objects or shared collections by the `use...end` keywords is mandatory to prevent concurrent access between processes.

- Once the **use** line is successfully executed, all *Shared_object_or_Shared_collection* properties/elements are locked for all other process in write access until the corresponding `end` line is executed.
- The *statement(s)* sequence can execute any modification on the *Shared_object_or_Shared_collection* properties/elements without risk of concurrent access.
- If another shared object or collection is added as a property of the *Shared_object_or_Shared_collection* parameter, they become connected within the same shared group.
- If another process tries to access one of the *Shared_object_or_Shared_collection* properties or connected properties while a **use...end** sequence is being executed, it is automatically put on hold and waits until the current sequence is terminated.
- The **end** line unlocks the *Shared_object_or_Shared_collection* properties and all objects of the same group.
- Several **use...end** structures can be nested in the QodlyScript code. In the case of a group, each **use** increments the locking counter of the group and each **end** decrements it; all properties/elements will be released only when the last **end** call sets the locking counter to 0.

:::note

If a function of the [collection class](../CollectionClass.md) modifies a shared collection, an internal **use** is automatically called for this shared collection while the function is executed.

## Examples

The following examples highlight specific rules when handling shared groups:

```qs
 ob1 = newSharedObject
 ob2 = newSharedObject
 use(ob1)
    ob1.a = ob2  //group 1 is created
 end

 ob3 = newSharedObject
 ob4 = newSharedObject
 use(ob3)
    ob3.a = ob4  //group 2 is created
 end

 use(ob1) //use an object from group 1
    ob1.b = ob4  //ERROR
  //ob4 already belongs to another group
  //assignment is not allowed
 end

 use(ob3)
    ob3.a = null //remove any reference to ob4 from group 2
 end

 use(ob1) //use an object from group 1
    ob1.b = ob4  //ERROR
  //ob4 still belongs to group 2
  //assignment is not allowed
 end
```
