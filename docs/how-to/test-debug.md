Different tools are available for testing at any time during your development, integration, and staging phases.

During development, you have two levels of preview: page level and application level.  During creating your page, you can preview it at any time. 

The previewer lets you view the entire application, making it easy to test all behaviors. If you find a bug, you can activate the debugger, which will guide you step by step to fix it. 
To check your data, use the Data Explorer to navigate or edit it.

You can also invite users with specific roles to test the application externally, which is the best way to gather their feedback.
