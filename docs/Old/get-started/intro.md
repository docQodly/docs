## Overview

Qodly is a global platform for developing, deploying, and running web applications. It consists of three main components:

- **Qodly Studio**: Develop and test your application.
- **Qodly Server**: Backend including 4D database, Web Server, and ORDA.
- **Cloud Console**: Manage your deployments.

Everything you need is included in your subscription. You can create your application from start to finish without installing anything.
You can also extend your widgets by building or installing custom components in Qodly Studio.
The best way to start is by creating your Sandbox. It's completely free and perfect for trying out Qodly, exploring samples, and testing new features. You can even create a quick demo for your client before beginning your application. You'll have the option to clone it or start from scratch.

## Creating your Sandbox

Creating your Sandbox is the first step for your journey in Qodly.

1. Sign Up and Log In: Create an account and log in to the platform.
2. Create your Sandbox
3. Start from scratch or choose a template from the catalog. You can delete and reinstall it as needed. The only limitation is one sandbox per user.

## Starting Your First Project or Application

1. Clone an existing app by clicking on "Clone" or start a new app and choose an application template.
2. Set Up App Details: Enter the project name, description, and other details.
3. Choose the resources you need for your development environment.
4. Add your billing details. You can add your own card or invite someone else to add theirs.
5. Subscribe.
6. Your development environment is installed. You can go to Qodly Studio and start building your app.
7. A welcome tour will begin for a quick overview of Qodly Studio.
8. Start from the frontend by dragging and dropping components (or widgets) or use pre-made templates. Alternatively, begin by preparing your data using the Data Model, code your functions, and then bind them with Qodly Sources to the frontend.

9. Manage roles and privileges in the editor.
10. Your app is ready for testing or deployment.
