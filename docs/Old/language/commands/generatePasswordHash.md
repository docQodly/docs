<!-- REF #_command_.generatePasswordHash.Syntax -->**generatePasswordHash** ( *password* : string , *options* : object ) : string <!-- END REF -->


<!-- REF #_command_.generatePasswordHash.Params -->
|Parameter|Type||Description|
|---------|--- |:---:|------|
|password|string|&#8594;|The user's password. Only the first 72 characters are used|
|options|object|&#8594;|An object containing options|
|Result|string|&#8592;|Returns the hashed password|
<!-- END REF -->

#### Description

The `generatePasswordHash` function <!-- REF #_command_.generatePasswordHash.Summary --> returns a secure password hash generated by a cryptographic hash algorithm<!-- END REF -->.

Pass a string value in the *password* parameter. The `generatePasswordHash` returns a hashed string for the password. Multiple passes of the same password will result in different hashed strings.

In the *options* object, pass the properties to use when generating the password hash. The available values are listed in the table below:

|Property|Value Type|Description|  Default Value |                                                       
|---------|--- |---|------|
|algorithm|string|algorithm to be used. Currently only "bcrypt" (case sensitive) is supported. |bcrypt|
|cost|number|speed to be used. The supported values for bcrypt are between 4 and 31.|10 |


:::note

If either value in the *options* object is invalid, an error message and an empty string will be returned.

##### Error management

The following errors may be returned. You can review an error with the `onErrCall` command.

|Number|Message|                                                                                    
|------|-------|
|850|Password-hash: Unsupported algorithm.|                                                      
|852|Password-hash: Unavailable bcrypt cost parameter, please provide a value between 4 and 31.|


##### About bcrypt

bcrypt is a password hashing function based on the Blowfish cipher. In addition to incorporating a salt to protect against rainbow table attacks, it's an adaptive function in which the iteration count can be increased to make it slower, so it remains resistant to brute-force attacks even with increasing computation power because it takes longer and becomes too time consuming and expensive.

#### Example

This example generates a password hash using bcrypt with a cost factor 4.

```qs
 declare(password : string , userId : integer)
 var hash : string
 var options : object
 var user : cs.UserEntity

 options = newObject("algorithm","bcrypt","cost",4)

 hash = generatePasswordHash(password,options)
 user = ds.User.get(userId)
 user.hash = hash
 user.save()

```

:::caution  Reminder

Multiple passes of the same password will result in different hashed strings. This is a standard behavior for algorithms such as bcrypt, since the best practice is to create a new, random salt for every hash. Refer to the [`verifyPasswordHash`](verifyPasswordHash.md) description for an example of how to check the passwords
