Qodly introduces the concept of **Custom Components**, empowering developers to extend the capabilities of the platform and tailor webforms to their specific needs. 

## What Are Custom Components?

**Custom Components** user-created building blocks developed to address unique requirements or introduce specific features not covered by the default set of Qodly built-in components. These components are crafted using React, providing a flexible and powerful foundation for developers.

## Benefits of Custom Components

The integration of Custom Components into Qodly Studio offers a range of advantages:

- **Extensibility**: Tailor webforms precisely to meet specific project requirements, providing a flexible and customizable solution.

- **Reusability**: Share Custom Components seamlessly across diverse projects or within the Qodly community. This fosters collective enhancement and collaboration among developers.

- **Efficiency**: Enhance development efficiency by utilizing pre-built Custom Components. This approach streamlines the development process, reducing time and costs associated with building components from scratch.

## Key Distinctions from Built-in Components

While Qodly Studio offers a variety of built-in components, Custom Components provide developers with the freedom to design and implement functionalities tailored to their projects. Key distinctions include:

| **Aspect**               | **Built-in Components**                                      | **Custom Components**                                        |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ease of Use**          | Easily accessible through drag-and-drop functionality.       | Requires manual development and implementation.                 |
| **Customization**        | Covers common use cases.                                     | Enables fine-tuning and specific adaptations.                 |
| **Unique Features**      | Offers a standard set of features.                           | Introduces new features or variations beyond the standard set.|
| **Tailored Appearance**  | Standardized visual design.                                  | Developers have full control over visual design for cohesive integration. |
| **Performance**          | Managed for optimal performance.                             | Performance depends on Qodler practices and maintenance.     |
| **Long-Term Advancement**| Regularly updated and managed internally.                    | Relies on the Qodler for updates, maintenance, and best practices adherence. |
| **Deprecation Risk**     | No risk of deprecation.                                      | Risk depends on Qodler's commitment to maintaining the component. |
